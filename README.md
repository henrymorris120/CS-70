# CS 70 Applied Computer Science
In this repository are a few selected projects from this course with some additional complexity added to them. PNG Images are mentioned in some of the code but their importance is minimal and can be changed out with no issues, and hence they are not uploaded. Beyond the mathematical analysis present in these projects, much effort was spent learning and implementing complicated python graphing techniques.
